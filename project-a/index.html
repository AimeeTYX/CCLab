                <h3 class="red">Scientific Name:</h3>
                <p>Luminius</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Lumibub was first dicovered by Dr. Orin Finch in 2047. Originally, he was trying to observe the blood sample of a captured alien. However, he forgot to drip the blood on the glass slide as he was heavily hit by the alien in the head. So there it was, on the "air slice" under the experimental quantum microscope, our first breathing Lumibub.</p>

                <h3 class="red">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>A soft, glowing bubble-like creature, with its edge flowing, indicating its hunger level.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Small air potions that are single void energy fields. The color and material form of the air will change according to the state of the lumibub within.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floats in the air.</li>
                    <li>Eats colored lights.</li>
                    <li>Most times hates people's touch.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>As Finch's discovery of the Lumibub (Luminius) was publish, many scientist have conducted relevant research and have up till now discovered Luminos in deep sea and Luminans in space.</p>

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Lumibub?</span>
                <p>Finch's later writings suggest that Lumibubs might not be entirly biological. They seem to exist between light and thought, feeding mainly on colored lights. Hunger is their greateset enemy: when ignored, they dim, fade and might die. <br>Finch once mentioned in an interview that he saw signs of Lumibub reacting to human activities, but the specific mechanism behind is not yet clear.</p> 
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature?</span> <p>Handle your Lumibub with gentle curiosity. It feeds on light and touch: Each click, each flicker of your attention becomes nourishment. Too little food, it starves; too much care, it may grow too attached. When it glows softly, it is content. When it flickers, it is hungry.</p>
